# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

To add a new changeset, run `yarn changeset` in the root of the repository. This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose a semver bump type (major / minor / patch) for each
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset file will be committed with your PR.

When it's time to release, run:

```bash
yarn changeset:version  # Apply version bumps and generate changelogs
yarn changeset:publish  # Build and publish to npm
```
